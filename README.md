# MW-PX4-Setup
Setup the PX4 toolchain to be compatible with Embedded Coder support package for PX4 Autopilots
# Introduction
Using  Embedded Coder support package for PX4 Autopilots, you can generate ANSI/ISO C++ from SimulinkÂ® models specifically tailored for the Pixhawk FMU (flight management unit) using the PX4 Toolchain. You can customize algorithms that leverage onboard sensor data and other calculations at runtime.

# PX4 toolchain setup
PX4 toolchain setup includes the installation of different third-party utilities like GCC 7.2.1, CMake 3.x,
            Ninja 1.6, Git, RTPS and certain Python packages.
